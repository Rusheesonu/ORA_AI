# Content Filter

This project implements a flexible content filtering system using TypeScript. The filtering logic can be adapted for various scenarios, such as detecting keywords, blocking certain patterns, or filtering inappropriate content. The codebase is structured to allow easy customization by utilizing a strategy pattern for filtering.

## Overview

The content filtering system is built around the `ContentFilter` class, which uses different filtering strategies, such as regular expressions, to check for patterns in text. The modular design allows you to easily adapt the logic to various filtering tasks.

This specific implementation focuses on detecting mentions of "Bitly" (e.g., `bitly.com`, `bit.ly`, `bitly`) using regular expressions.

## Installation

To get started with this project Build, Run and Test:

1. Clone the repository:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/your-username/content-filter.git
   cd content-filter
   npm install
   npm run build
   npm test
   ```
   
### Filtering Approach

The filtering system uses a Strategy Pattern, which decouples the filtering logic from specific implementations. Here's how it works:

Normalization: The input text is cleaned by removing punctuation, URLs, and converting the text to lowercase for case-insensitive matching.
Pattern Matching: The RegexFilterStrategy is used to detect patterns defined via regular expressions.
Modularity: The system can be easily modified to use different strategies (e.g., keyword-based filtering) or adapt to other filtering tasks.

## Examples
Here are a few test cases demonstrating the filter's performance:

Positive Matches:
Input: 'Check out bit.ly for more info!'

Output: true (Detected bit.ly)

Input: 'Visit bitly.com for details.'

Output: true (Detected bitly.com)

Negative Matches:

Input: 'This is a test.'

Output: false (No mention of bitly)

Input: 'Check out https://bit.ly/abc123'

Output: false (URLs are removed before filtering)

## Assumptions & Limitations

Assumptions:
The input is assumed to be a valid string. Non-string inputs (e.g., null, undefined) will trigger errors.
The regular expression patterns are case-insensitive and work with common variations of the target strings.
URLs are stripped from the input before pattern matching.

Limitations:
The current implementation focuses solely on regular expression-based filtering. While effective for this use case, it may not be suitable for more complex filtering needs.
The filter may struggle with very large datasets unless optimized for performance.
Shortened or complex URLs might bypass detection since the system strips URLs before filtering.

## Future Improvements

- Extended Filtering Strategies: 
   Implement additional filtering strategies (e.g., keyword-based, AI-based) for greater flexibility.

- Performance Optimization: 
   Add optimizations for large datasets, possibly through distributed processing or other scaling techniques.
  
- Dynamic Pattern Loading: 
   Allow patterns to be loaded dynamically from external sources such as APIs or databases.
  
- Configurable Normalization: 
   Make text normalization configurable, enabling or disabling steps like URL removal based on user needs.
